A quick repo to work on implementing layer normalization in keras's LSTM

This is a beginner project for me to help me learn understand keras + theano and tensorflow.

Tools:
- python 2.7, but trying to keep close to python 3.5 compatible
- Using keras (https://github.com/fchollet/keras) from git master,
- git checkout of theano, 
- tensorflow 0.10
- ipython 5.0
- jupyter 5.0 notebook
