A quick repo to work on implementing layer normalization in keras's LSTM

This is a beginner project for me to help me learn understand keras + theano and tensorflow.

python 2.7, but trying to keep close to python 3.5 compatible
Using keras from git master, git checkout of theano, tensorflow 0.10
ipython 5.0
jupyter 5.0 notebook
-C
